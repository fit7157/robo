    <h2>This robot has two options for movment. One is wheels and the other is legs.</h2>

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>This robot can change its way to move by itself by detecting the height of terrain.
        If it meets a terrain that is hard to move by wheels, it changes its way of movement.
        This can diversify the method of maneuverance and improve the maneuverability of the robot.
