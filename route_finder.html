    <h1>ROUTE FINDER</h1>

    <h2 class="discription">This robot recognizes the obstacle around through ultra sonic sensor.
        This helps the robot know whether there are obstacles around and prevent the clash. It can find a route to go through autonomously.

    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <p>This is a robot that can go through maze. The route has only one way and this robot can go through the way without collapsing.
        This can be done by two radar sensors that is attatched at the side of the robot. The sensors are distinguished by the direction.
        If the obstacle is detected at the left sensor of the robot, the robot is programmed to turn right for 0.3miliseconds.
        If the obstacle is detected at the right sensor of the robot, the robot is programmed to turn left for 0.3miliseconds.
        This enables it to avoid the crash and go through the route.
    </p>

    <h2>Future usage</h2>
    <p>This can be used when it goes through diverse situations that humans can not go through like inside of a small cave or construction site.
        This robot can find the way to go through without any control.
    </p>

    <h2>Future development</h2>
    <p>I'd like to add other moving methods in order to go through diverse terrains. There are limitations on wheel based moves.
        To solve this problem, adding legs or propellors can give the robot another option to move.
        Also, adding camera can help collecting data and make more usabilities.
